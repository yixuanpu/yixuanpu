My name is Yixuan Pu. I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from Lanzhou University, China and will gain my master’s degree in Physical Chemistry at the University of Science and Technology of China. My work is focusing on solving catalytic issues with computational methods. I am interested in using first-principles computational modeling and machine learning approaches to understand and predict catalysts for use in energy storage, sustainable chemical production and reducing the environmental impact of products. Leveraging the machine learning algorithms, I will be able to analyze experimental data and identify the key factors that influence the catalytic performance, such as size effect and the interaction between catalyst and support.

RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
